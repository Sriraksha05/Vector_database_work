Worked on Vector database ,how to use FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) to create a vector index for similarity search .The code includes two types of indices: a flat (brute-force) index and an inverted file (IVF) index with quantization. 
Used Fast API and Uvicorn server . Further need to dockerize this project. :)
